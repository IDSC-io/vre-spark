# VRE Screening data merging

This is where the raw erratic screening data resides. The merging was done in a jupyter notebook in order to give better explanations of why the merging was done this way. The jupyter notebook for this is in [notebooks/merge_vre_data.ipynb](../../../notebooks/merge_vre_data.ipynb) and turns all this mess into the file  [data/raw/model_dataVRE_SCREENING_DATA.csv](../model_data/VRE_SCREENING_DATA.csv). 

The results seem to match with the results of Spitalhygiene and IFIK that around 580 patients were tested positive between 2017.01.12 and 2020.06.06.
